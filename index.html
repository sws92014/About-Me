 			<h1>Introduction</h1>

  			<h1>More About Me</h1>
  			<h2>What's most important to you?</h2>
  			<p>The most important thing to me is my family. My family always comes first! Without them I wouldn’t be the person I am today.</p>
  			<p>The second most important part of my life is design. I’m always trying to learn new techniques and stay on trend. Like I said before, I’m passionate about design and I would never turn in any work that I’m not proud to put my name on.</p>
  			<p>Lastly, food is important to me. I never travel without looking up a good place to eat first!</p>
  			<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  			<p>Besides designing, which I seem to be doing all the time…. I’m exploring my own entrepreneurial adventure with my etsy site where I design invitations, logo designs, wedding invites, and other graphic design solutions for people all over the country. In addition to that I like to paint as well.</p>
  			<h2>What’s your dream job?</h2>
  			<p>I’d love to open my own design firm one day!</p>
  			<h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  			<p>I’m pretty eclectic when it comes to music and listen to pop, EDM, all the way to country music. My playlist will go from Taylor Swift to Skrillex and everywhere in between.</p>
